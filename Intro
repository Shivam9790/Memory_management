Memory cell is an electronic circuit that strores one-byte of binary information. Each memory cell has a unique address.
Executed programs are stored in resident memory. Turbo C 3.0 stores 1MB of data in RAM. compiler decides the memnory address of the variables.
segemntation is the division of 1MB RAM size into 16 parts which are called segments. Each segment is of 64KB. 
A pointer is a variable that stores memory address of any variable it is created *operator.
The segment address, located within one of the segment registers, defines the beginning address of any 64K-byte memory segment. 
The offset address selects any location within the 64K byte memory segment. Segments in the real mode always have a length of 64K bytes.
A data segment is a portion of the virtual address space of a program, which contains the global variables and static variables that are initialized by the programmer. 
Stack memory is a memory usage mechanism that allows the system memory to be used as temporary data storage that behaves as a first-in-last-out buffer
Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.
